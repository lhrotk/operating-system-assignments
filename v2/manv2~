======================================================================
The program measures the performance of exchanging signal for 100 times
between two children.

V1 follow the method mentioned in Version2. However because the children
do not know each other at first, one child have to sleep for a time so that
the first signal SIGUSR1 it send will not kill another child. Child1 and
child2 exchange PID with named pipe. The two pipes only allows read or
write only to avoid one child reads its own PID.

The synchronization during exchange is done by a lock: int s.

the child makes s = 0 after it send signal and fall into dead loop.
the child makes s = 1 after it receive signal which break the dead loop.

This synchronization makes sure one child will not send a signal before it
receive a signal, and prepared for a coming signal using "signal()" when it 
try to send a signal.

Please refer to annotation in source code for details.
