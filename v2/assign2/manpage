Usage: make [option]
  clean,			clean all files apart from source file.
  man,				show the manual.
  all, 				compile the files
IMPORTANT: 
   The makefile do not run the program automatically. You should run the
program like this:
   ./sercli.out [--lambda[0.005]] [--mu [0.01]] [--servers[2]] --[clients[2
   ]]
For example:
   ./sercli.out --lambda 0.5 --mu 0.02 --servers 5 --clients 5
   run the progrom with 5 servers and 5 clients with lambda = 0.5 and mu = 
   0.02

   You should strictly follow the syntax above!

Description:
   The program emulates a set of servers and a set of clients who continuously
   generate tasks and consume tasks in one task quene. The servers and clients do 
   synchronization under the control of a clock thread using mutex lock. 'Suspend'
   and 'wakeup' is done by prototype algorithm like signal() and wait() introduced
   in class.

   This program did not use pthread_cond_wait and pthread_cond_signal because
   the clock and the set of servers and clients wait each other like in the last 
   assignment and it is complex to use conditional variables. 
   However, the data is well protected by a mutex and no server or client can be 
   emitted more than once in a signal tick in my solution.

   This method uses signal() and wait() with a signal initialized to the sum of 
   servers and clients. Just equal to providing some products in one tick and the 
   servers, clients consume it together avoiding confliction using mutex. They also
   check the loop register to see wether they have do the consumption in the loop.
   If they need to wait for the next tick, they will block though there is food 
   remains.

   Total waiting time is record by accumulate how many tasks remain at the end of
    a tick.

   Total excution time is record by accumulate how many server is BUSY in a tick.

   Total turnaround time is done by add Total wait time and Total excute time.

   Total quene length is done by add the length of quene at each tick together.

   Total interarriavl time is 1000 ticks.

   As we know how many tasks are generated and the program is run for 1000 ticks,
   We can calculate AWT, AXT, ATA, AQL and AIA.
