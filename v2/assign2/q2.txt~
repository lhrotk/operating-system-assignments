1. man pthread + tab
you can find all function calls in pthread.h
the naming convention can be sumarized as pthread_[function name].
   Or check the manual by install manpages-posix first.
(man pthread.h) 

2.mutex, reader-writer lock, condition variable, spin lock, barrier

3.	pthread_mutex_lock(&mtx); 	
	while(!condition){
		pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mtx);
	}
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtx);
/*
  The loop check the condition can continue waiting if someone has already react
to the condition. pthread_cond_signal can wake up at least one thread, but only 
one can enter the critical region. Let the extra thread wait is required.
*/
(man pthread_cond_wait)

4.the thread owns the mutex will run.
  If there are many threads waiting, only one can get the mutex though at least one thread is woke up.

5.If there are other threads waiting for the mutex, they also get blocked by the condition.

6.The  pthread_detach()  function  marks  the thread identified by thread as detached.  When a detached thread terminates, its resources are automatically released back to the system without the need for another thread  to  join  with  the  terminated
thread.

Attempting to detach an already detached thread results in unspecified behavior.
(man pthread_detach)
