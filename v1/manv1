======================================================================
The program measures the performance of exchanging signal for 100 times
between two children.

V1 follow the method mentioned in Version1. However because the children
do not know each other at first, we can notify the brother of a known pid 
by send signal SIGUSR2 while another child is waiting with sigaction() and
sigsuspend();

The synchronization during exchange is done by block the signal.

function sigsuspend(&mask) makes the process suspend waiting for any signal
unblocked in sigset_t mask. At any time SIGUSR1 is blocked in these two 
children because I block the signal in their father. One child will call
sigsuspend() when it prepared for a coming signal (unblock SIGUSR1) and soon
block it again so that it will not be killed if the signal comes when it
is not prepared.

This synchronization makes sure one child will not send a signal before it
receive a signal, and prepared for a coming signal using "signal()" when it 
try to send a signal.

Please refer to annotation in source code for details.
